# COINBASE -- Bringing Crytpocurrency to the Masses

## Overview and Origin

Coinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam as one of the first digital currency exchanges in the United States. It offers brokerage services to a variety of clients interested in the cryptocurrency marketplace. They are one of the largest and most well-known brokerages in the space growing rapidly over the last decade. Brian Armstrong had worked in the tech space as a software engineer and Fred Ehrsam as a trader at Goldman Sachs, those backgrounds combined with their idea that everyone should have easy access to the cryptocurrency markets led to the developement of Coinbase first in Y-combinator, and later through a series of investments from some of the most well-known Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley. 

## Business Activities

Cyrptocurrency has been the new frontier in finance for the past 10-years, ever since Bitcoin starting running in 2009. A combination of media hype, eclectic personalities, political tribes and billions of dollars flooding the space have captured the attention of entreprenuers and legacy financial institutions alike. Coinbase saw this opportunity early, and by 2012 developed an exchange that could legally operate in the United States and provide an easy on-ramp for crypto investment for US-based customers. There is no denying bad actors and fraud exist in the crytpo atmosphere. Coinbase sees itself as a pioneer that can introduce the masses to this new world of crytpo while protecting its customers from bad actors. This is what makes Coinbase so successful, it demystifies the crypto world, makes it easy for a non-tech investor to gain exposure to the space and protects that customer. It charges fees for these services that people have been more than willing to pay. 

As one of the first in the rapidly growing space, Coinbase has made its founders billionaires. It has received several hundred million dollars in venture capital over the past several years. The most recent round raised $300M valuing the company at $8 Billion. 

It has hudnreds of competitors with Gemini, Binance and Kraken being some of the most well-known. It is not the biggest exchange by trading volume but is 1) arguably the most well-known 2) has access to the US Market. While it does not operate in as many markets as some of its competitors being the leader in the United States counts for a lot. 

Blockchain, cloud infrastructure and mobile applications are all enormous parts of Coinbases' business. Their mobile app makes anyone with a smart phone a potential crypto investor.  It is easy to use and secure. They are in charge of custodial services for billions of dollars worth of crytpo assets that exist on various blockchains. The security infrastructure in place to secure those assets is immense.  For people like me it is intimidating to venture into the engineering section of their website. 

## Landscape

Brokerage and exchange services historically have been the domain of major Wall Street financial institutions in the United States and their counterparts in Tokyo, London, Frankfurt, Beijing and Hong Kong. Large wall street banks and exchanges have not been quick to embrace crytpocurrency and treat digital assets as a legitimate place for people to invest their wealth. This has allowed companies like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken to take the lead where presumably Wall Street should dominate. While the landscape might be changing, it has not changed quick enough among the large institutional players to compete with the newcomers. Arguably, Fidelity has been one of the only large scale financial institutions to really embrace crytpo. 

## Results

Coinbase has been hugely successful since its inception. It now operates in over 100 markets, employees over 1,000 people, has $7B in custodied assets and is valued at $8B. The succsess has made its founders billionaires, and there has been a lot of recent talk about Coinbase filing an IPO taking the company public. It would most likely be one of the most in-demand and closely watched IPOs. This entire industry is just getting started and Coinbase is at the forefront. 

## Recommendations

The crypto atmosphere is one of the most unique I have encountered in my limited study of different business environments. According to some of the loudest voices in crytpo space, the whole point of crypto is to be able to operate outside of the legacy financial system. To a certain extent, Coinbase brings the legacy financial system to crypto. How is this going to work going forward? I think they will need to find a way to navigate this and it will always be an option for those out there that want exposure to crypto but do not want the responsiblity of "being your own bank." 

Additionally, as the most well-known in the space they have somewhat of a luxury of charging high fees for their services. There are several up and coming exchanges that see this as a vulnerability and are offering low or no fee options. They no dobut have a plan for this, and as user growth increases they could probably lower transaction fees for customers. They offer a "pro" subscription model that doesn't have those fees but additional cost, so it may not be the best option for the occasional trader or novice investor. Their growth is enormous, so the costs are not prohibitively expensive, but might be an issue down the road with more competition. 

Another potential downside for Coinbase is the limited offerings.  They are very selective about who is listed on their exchange and while this is a source of pride as each project is more thoroughly scrutinized prior to being granted a listing on the exchange.  While this can be seen as a great feature, people may use Coinbase strictly as an on-ramp and immediately move their funds elsewhere to trade/invest. As the ecosystem grows this might be a drawback.  While it works very well now, increasing listings to meet the demand of traders might be beneficial. 

I think their list of products for a relatively new company is pretty remarkable. If anything I think their next step should be centered around making Coinbase a household name to people beyond that live and breathe it. Whether that is a big marketing splash or educational efforts (partnering with institutions of higher learning), I don't know. If people hear Bitcoin or crypto in conversation they should think of Coinbase immediately. 

It also should be noted that the interests of an individual company like Coinbase may not always align with the success of a decentralized, trustless, electronic cash systems which they offer access to.  I think there will be a role for places like Coinbase for the coming decades but with everything becoming "decentralized" eventually big, centralized institutions may find themselves out of work. Right now the user experience for crypto is not great for the average person, Coinbase makes it easy.
